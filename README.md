PyMC3 Model for MCMC (Markov Chain Monte Carlo), classification
Awake and Asleep models from Garmin datasets
Import required libraries and viisualize both datasets (sleep and waking data)
Sleep and Wake data are from Garmin indicating weather a person is asleep or awake based on motion sensing and heart rate
My objective is to use this data to create a model that returns the probability I am asleep at a given time. The final goal can be mathematically expressed as:
ùëÉ(awake|time)
